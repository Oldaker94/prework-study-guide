## Description

This is the README for my Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp Prework Study Guide Website!

- I wanted to create a study guide that would help me and other students understand the different types of code, keywords, and what their functions are to better navigate through our classes. 
- I built this project for practice while teaching myself how to properly code a functioning website
- This website helped me better understand how to code, and gives me a place to come back to if I get lost and need to remember certain keywords and commands along with their functions. 
- I learned a lot about what it really means to build a website from the ground up. I also learned a lot about myself having been away from schooling and extra carricular activities. I developed better habits when it comes to learning, I find it much better for me to retain information in a self teaching environment if I complete my work in one go, rather than taking my time with it, doing a little each day.

This Prework Study Guide can be used to help remind yourself of the basic functions and key commands of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. There is a lot of information to take in when it comes to learning how to code, it can be easy to forget these certain phrases and commands that you'll need to succeed. This website will act as a refresher to come back to if you're lost! If you access the website and open DevTools or F12, you'll see that Javascript is running and will automatically choose a subject for you to start studying with!
